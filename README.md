# Machine Learning Projects

Welcome to my Machine Learning projects repository! This repository contains a collection of projects that demonstrate various machine learning techniques, algorithms, and applications.

### Projects Included:
- **Supervised Learning**: Projects based on regression, classification, Ensemble techniques and other supervised learning algorithms.
- **Unsupervised Learning**: Projects involving clustering, dimensionality reduction, and other unsupervised techniques.
- **Reinforcement Learning**: Explorations in reinforcement learning algorithms and applications.
- **Other ML Applications**: Various experiments and applications of machine learning, such as recommendation systems, anomaly detection, etc.

Each project is organized in its own folder, and you can explore the code, models, and datasets used in the respective projects.

### Technologies Used:
- Python
- scikit-learn
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn (for data visualization)
- Jupyter Notebooks (for experimentation and documentation)

Feel free to explore, fork, or contribute to these projects. For any questions, open an issue or reach out!
